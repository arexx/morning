Condensed morning information for our living room. Probably not much use to you unless you are a recruiter interested in looking at my code quality, in which case, wow, that's some detailed research!

You'll need to create hello/secrets.py using this template to run this project yourself (but why would you?):

    class WUNDERLIST(object):
	    CLIENT_ID = "<YOUR WUNDERLIST CLIENT APP ID>"
	    ACCESS_TOKEN = "<YOUR WUNDERLIST USER ACCESS TOKEN>"
	    LIST_ID = "<YOUR WUNDERLIST LIST ID>"
